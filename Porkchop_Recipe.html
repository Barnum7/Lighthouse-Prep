				<h3>For the porkchops</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Place the skillet on the middle rack in your oven. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
						<li>Remove the porkchops from the brine or their packaging. If removing from brine pat dry with a paper towel.</li>
						<li>Rub both sides of the porkchops with olive oil, then season them with salt and pepepr</li>
						<li>Use oven mitts to remove the skillet from the oven, then place it on the stove top at medium-high heat. It would be wise to turn on a vent fan or open a window</li>
						<li>Lay the porkchops on the hot skillet. They should start to sizzle immediately. Sear until the undersides of the chop are golden. This should take about 3 minutes. Don't panic if they start to smoke a little bit</li>
						<li>Flip the chops and immediately transfer the skillet to the oven. Let the chops roast until the thickest part of the meat registers an internal temperature of 140-145 degrees fahrenheit. This should take 6-10 minutes</li>
						<li>Rest the chops. Tent them loosely in foil for 5 minutes before serving</li>
					</ol>
